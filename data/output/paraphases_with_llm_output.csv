Machine Learning - Deployment,What common issue causes deployed machine learning models to degrade over time?,"user
What common issue causes deployed machine learning models to degrade over time?
assistant
One common issue that causes deployed machine learning models to degrade over time is **concept drift**. Concept drift refers to the phenomenon where the underlying patterns or relationships in the data that the model was trained on change over time, rendering the model's predictions less accurate. This can occur due to various factors such as changes in user behavior, shifts in environmental conditions, or even seasonal variations.

For instance, a model trained to predict customer churn based on historical data might become less accurate if customer preferences or market conditions change over time. Other contributing factors to concept drift include:

Changes in data distribution, such as shifts in feature distributions or the introduction of new features
Changes in the relationships between features and the target variable
Evolution of the underlying problem or task itself

To mitigate concept drift, techniques such as continuous monitoring, periodic retraining, and online learning can be employed to adapt the model to the changing data distribution and maintain its performance over time."
